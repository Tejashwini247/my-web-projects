    <p>Sandwiches are a quick and delicious meal that can be made with a variety of ingredients.
     They are perfect for breakfast, lunch, or a snack. With fresh vegetables, cheese, and optional proteins like chicken or eggs, 
     sandwiches are both <b> nutritious </b> and <b >satisfying.</b>
     <br> Making a sandwich is simple, and it can be customized to suit anyone’s taste.
      I like them because they are <i> cheesy,</i> and <i> loaded with veggies,</i>
      sandwich is always a tasty choice. 
        <br> To me, sandwiches are not just food- they are simple, fun, and satisfying.
